### **Welcome to Yeju's github**👻

<br />

I'm senior studying biosystems and biomedical 5sciences at Korea university. I was learning about how the human body and its cells have changed from birth to death and the relationship between humans and disease. I'm currently interested in bioinformatics and finding the function of RNA and unknown regions of DNA by computational thinking. The discovery of the roles of these sequences, including repeated DNA sequence, miRNA, etc., which are still unknown, will be able to promote enormous development not only in the pharmaceutical and clinical sectors but also in the food industry and environmental issues. I hope to be one of the people standing in the middle of the development.
